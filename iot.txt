INTRODUCTION  The Internet of Things (IoT) is the  network of physical objects—devices,  instruments, vehicles, buildings and other items embedded with electronics,  circuits  ,software,  sensors  and network  connectivity  that  enables these  objects  to collect and exchange data. The Internet of Things allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating  opportunities for  more direct  integration of  the physical  world into  computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency and accuracy.    The concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982, with a modified Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University becoming the first internet-connected appliance [3], able to report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were  cold. Kevin Ashton (born 1968) is a British technology pioneer who is  known for inventing the term "the Internet of Things" to describe a system where the Internet is connected to the physical world via ubiquitous sensors.    IoT is able to interact without human intervention. Some preliminary IoT applications have been already developed in healthcare, transportation, and automotive industries. IoT technologies are at their infant stages; however, many new developments have occurred in the integration of objects with sensors in the Internet. The development of IoT involves many issues such as infrastructure, communications, interfaces, protocols, and standards. The objective of this  paper is  to give  general concept of IoT, the architecture and layers in  IoT, some  basic terms associated with it and the services provided.  II. CONCEPT OF IOT     Kevin Ashton firstly proposed the concept of IoT in 1999, and he referred the IoT as uniquely identifiable connected objects  with radio-frequency  identification (RFID)  technology.  However, the  exact  definition of  IoT  is still  in the forming  process that  is  subject  to  the perspectives  taken.  IoT  was  generally  defined  as  “dynamic  global  network infrastructure with self-configuring capabilities based on standards and communication protocols”.   Fig.2.1 Evolution of Internet [1] 
                                                                    Looking at the evolution of the Internet we can classify it into five eras: 1. The Internet of Documents -- e-libraries, document based webpages. 2. The Internet of Commerce -- e-commerce, e-banking and stock trading websites. 3. The Internet of Applications -- Web 2.0 4. The Internet of People -- Social networks. 5. The Internet of Things -- Connected devices and machines.      Physical and  virtual things in an  IoT have their  own identities and attributes and are  capable of using intelligent interfaces and  being integrated  as an  information network.  In easy  terms IoT  can be  treated as  a set  of connected devices that are uniquely identifiable. The words “Internet” and “Things” mean an inter-connected world-wide network based  on sensors,  communication,  networking,  and  information processing  technologies,  which  might be  the  new version of information and communications technology (ICT). To date, a number of technologies are involved in IoT, such  as  wireless  sensor  networks  (WSNs),  barcodes,  intelligent  sensing,  RFID,  NFCs,  low  energy  wireless communications, cloud computing and so on.    The IoT describes the next generation of Internet, where the physical things could be accessed and identified through the Internet. Depending on various technologies for the implementation, the definition of the IoT varies. However, the fundamental of IoT implies that objects in an IoT can be identified uniquely in the virtual representations. Within an IoT, all things are able to exchange data and if needed, process data according to predefined schemes.  III. ARCHITECTURE OF IOT          A critical requirement of an IoT is that the things in the network must be connected to each other.  IoT system architecture must guarantee the operations of IoT, which connects the physical and the virtual worlds. Design of IoT architecture involves many factors such as networking, communication, processes etc. In designing the architecture of IoT, the extensibility, scalability, and operability among devices should be taken into consideration. Due to the fact that things may  move and need  to interact  with others in real-time  mode, IoT  architecture should  be adaptive  to make devices interact with other dynamically and support communication amongst them. In addition, IoT should possess the decentralized and heterogeneous nature.
